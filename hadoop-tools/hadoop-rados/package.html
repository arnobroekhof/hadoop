<body>

<p>A distributed, block-based implementation of {@link
    org.apache.hadoop.fs.FileSystem} that uses <a href="http://ceph.comf">Ceph Rados</a>
    as a backing store.</p>

<p>
    Files are stored in Ceph as blocks (represented by
    {@link org.apache.hadoop.fs.rados.Block}), which have an ID and a length.
    Block metadata is stored in Ceph as a small record (represented by
    {@link org.apache.hadoop.fs.rados.INode}) using the URL-encoded
    path string as a key. Inodes record the file type (regular file or directory) and the list of blocks.
    This design makes it easy to seek to any given position in a file by reading the inode data to compute
    which block to access,
    Renames are also efficient since only the inode name is altered
</p>

<p>
    For a single file <i>/dir1/file1</i> which takes two blocks of storage, the file structure in Rados
    would be something like this:
</p>
<pre>
/
/dir1
/dir1/file1
block-6415776850131549260
block-3026438247347758425
</pre>
<p>
    Inodes start with a leading <code>/</code>, while blocks are prefixed with <code>block-</code>.
